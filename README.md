# Bi-Directional Sign Language Translator

This project was developed as part of college's major project to bridge communication between sign language users and non-signers. It provides real-time translation in both directions, from sign language to text and vice versa.

## Features

- **Sign-to-Text**: Translates sign language gestures into text using computer vision and machine learning.
- **Text-to-Sign**: Converts text into sign language gestures, displayed for non-signers.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Ensures smooth, instant translation for conversations.

## Usage
